      <h1>Mexican Tilapia Ceviche</h1>
      <p>
        Ceviche is originally a Peruvian dish. Over time latin countries adopted
        the meal as well! The first time I had ceviche was in a mexican
        restaurant so that seems to be the style I gravitate towards. You use
        raw fish and marinate it in lemon or lime juice until the proteins in
        the fish react and turn white. It's pretty cool! This ceviche is a
        delicious fresh meal to enjoy on a summer night!
