      <h1>Animal Kingdom Salad</h1>
      <p>
        This is my copycat salad recipe from Disney's Animal Kingdom. This salad
        has a smokey chicken flavor, fresh greens and bursts of popping fruit
        juice. It's from satu'li canteen in Avitar World. It's not the easiest
        recipie in the world but it's definitely worth it!

      <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          To make the grilled canteen chicken, combine 1/4 cup canola oil 3 TBS
          apple cider vinegar 3 TBS fresh minced garlic Kosher salt and pepper
          to taste in a medium storage container. Add in the chicken breasts
          (cut in half long ways). Let marinate covered, in the fridge for a few
          hours if you’re able to. Then grill the chicken (outside grill is
          best) until the internal temperature is 165. It’s best to serve the
          chicken cold, I make the chicken the day before, then cut into 1 inch
          cubes and refrigerate until the next day.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          To make the crunchy slaw, combine the ingredients listed and let
          marinate for a couple of hours.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          For the dressing, combine the ingredients - these don’t have to
          marinate!
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          As for the salad base, precut and washed kale and lettuce is nice but
          if it’s whole you can just cut up the greens and wash them. If you
          have a salad spinner, it’s a life saver in this situation. But patting
          the lettuce dry is another option.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Assemble your salad! Use the lettuce/kale as the base, then the
          grilled chicken, dressing, slaw and then the boba poppers! Enjoy this
          delicious meal!
